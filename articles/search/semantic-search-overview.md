# Semantic search in Azure Cognitive Search

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Semantic search features are in public preview, available through the preview REST API only. Preview features are offered as-is, under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Semantic search is a collection of query-related features that support a higher-quality, more natural query experience. Features include semantic reranking of search results, as well as captions and answers generation with semantic highlighting. The top 50 results returned from the [full text search engine](search-lucene-query-architecture.md) are reranked to find the most relevant matches.

The underlying technology leverages the investments from Bing and Microsoft Research, and is integrated into the Cognitive Search infrastructure. To use it, you'll need small modifications to the search request, but no extra configuration or reindexing is required.

Public preview features include:

+ Semantic ranking algorithm that retrieves relevant documents based on the context or semantic meaning of search query terms
+ Semantic captions that highlight relevant passages
+ Semantic answers to the query, also formulated from results
+ Spell check that corrects typos before the query terms reach the search engine

## Semantic search architecture

Components of semantic search are layered on top of the existing query execution pipeline. Spell correction (not shown in the diagram) improves recall by correcting typos in individual query terms. After all parsing and analysis are complete, the search engine retrieves the documents that matched the query and scores them using the [default scoring algorithm](index-similarity-and-scoring.md#similarity-ranking-algorithms), either BM25 or classic, depending on when the service was created. Scoring profiles are also applied at this stage. 

Having received the top 50 matches, the [semantic ranking algorithm](semantic-how-to-query-response.md) re-evaluates the document corpus. Results can include more than 50 matches, but only the first 50 will be reranked. For ranking, the algorithm uses both machine learning and transfer learning to re-score the documents based on how well each one matches the intent of the query.

To create captions and answers, it uses language representation models. Within a caption, the algorithm uses a language model developed by Bing to extract captions with highlights that best summarize query results. If the search query is a question, and answers are requested, a similar language model identifies text passages that best answer the question as expressed by the search query.

## Availability and pricing

Semantic ranking is available through [sign-up registration](https://aka.ms/SemanticSearchPreviewSignup), on search services created at a Standard tier (S1, S2, S3), located in one of these regions: North Central US, West US, West US 2, East US 2, North Europe, West Europe. Spell correction is available in the same regions, but has no tier restrictions. If you have an existing service that meets tier and region criteria, only sign up is required.

Between preview launch on March 2 through April 1, spell correction and semantic ranking are offered free of charge. After April 1, the computational costs of running this functionality will become a billable event. The expected cost is about USD $500/month for 250,000 queries. You can find detailed cost information documented in the [Cognitive Search pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) and in [Estimate and manage costs](search-sku-manage-costs.md).
