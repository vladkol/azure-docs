# Set up your Azure Percept DK and deploy your first AI model

Get started with Azure Percept DK and Azure Percept Studio by using the Azure Percept DK setup experience to connect your device to Azure and to deploy your first AI model. After verifying that your Azure account is compatible with Azure Percept Studio, you complete the setup experience to ensure your Azure Percept DK is configured to create Edge AI proof of concepts.

If you experience any issues during this Quick Start, refer to the [troubleshooting](./troubleshoot-dev-kit.md) guide for possible solutions.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Percept DK.
- A Windows, Linux, or OS X based host computer with wi-fi capability and a web browser.
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
- The Azure account must have the “owner” or “contributor” role on the subscription. Learn more about [Azure role definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#azure-roles).

### Prerequisite check

To verify if your Azure account is an “owner” or “contributor” on the subscription, following these steps.

1. Go to the Azure portal and log in with the same Azure account you intend to use with Azure Percept Studio. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have multiple Azure accounts, your browser may cache credentials from another account. See the troubleshooting guide for more information on how to ensure you are signed in with the correct account.

1. Expand the main menu from the upper left corner of your screen and click on “Subscriptions” or select “Subscriptions” from the menu of icons on the home page.

    --->
1. Select your subscription from the list. If you do not see your subscription in the list, make sure you are signed in with the correct Azure account. 
    <!---
    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-percept-dk-setup/prereq-02-sub-list.png" alt-text="supscription list in Azure portal.":::
    --->
If you wish to create a new subscription, follow [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription).

1. From the Subscription menu select “Access control (IAM)”
1. Click on the “View my access” button
1. Check the role
    - If it shows the role of “Reader” or if you get a message that says you do not have permissions to see roles, you will need to follow the necessary process in your organization to get your account role elevated.
    - If it shows the role as “owner” or “contributor”, your account will work with Azure Percept Studio. 

## Launch the Azure Percept DK Setup Experience

<!---
> [!NOTE]
> Connecting over ethernet? See [this how-to guide](<link needed>) for detailed instructions.
--->
1. Connect your host computer directly to the dev kit’s wi-fi access point. This is done just like connecting to any other wi-fi network,
    - **network name**: scz-xxxx (where “xxxx” is the last four digits of the dev kit’s MAC network address)
    - **password**: can be found on the Welcome Card that came with the dev kit

    > [!WARNING]
    > While connected to the Azure Percept DK wi-fi access point, your host computer will temporarily lose its connection to the Internet. Active video conference calls, web streaming, or other network-based experiences will be interrupted until step 3 of the Azure Percept DK setup experience is completed.

1. Once connected to the dev kit’s wi-fi access point, the host device will automatically launch the Azure Percept DK setup experience in a new browser window. If it does not automatically open, you can launch it manually by opening a browser window and navigating to [http://10.1.1.1](http://10.1.1.1). 

1. Now that you have launched the Azure Percept setup experience, you are ready to proceed through the setup experience. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Azure Percept DK setup experience web service will shut down after 30 minutes of non-use and at the completion of the setup experience. When this happens, it is recommended to restart the dev kit to avoid connectivity issues with the dev kit wi-fi access point.
