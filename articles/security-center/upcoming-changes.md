## Planned changes

- [Recommendations from AWS will be released for general availability (GA)](#recommendations-from-aws-will-be-released-for-general-availability-ga)
- [Two legacy recommendations will no longer write data directly to Azure activity log](#two-legacy-recommendations-will-no-longer-write-data-directly-to-azure-activity-log)
- [Two recommendations from "Apply system updates" security control being deprecated](#two-recommendations-from-apply-system-updates-security-control-being-deprecated)

- [Deprecation of 11 Azure Defender alerts](#deprecation-of-11-azure-defender-alerts)


### Recommendations from AWS will be released for general availability (GA)

**Estimated date for change:** April 2021

Azure Security Center protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The recommendations coming from AWS Security Hub have been in preview since the cloud connectors were introduced. Recommendations flagged as **Preview** aren't included in the calculations of your secure score, but should still be remediated wherever possible, so that when the preview period ends they'll contribute towards your score.

With this change, two sets of AWS recommendations will move to GA:

- [Security Hub's PCI DSS controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-pci-controls.html)
- [Security Hub's CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cis-controls.html)

When these are GA and the assessments run on your AWS resources, the results will impact your combined secure score for all your multi and hybrid cloud resources. 



### Two legacy recommendations will no longer write data directly to Azure activity log 

**Estimated date for change:** March 2021

Security Center passes the data for almost all security recommendations to Azure Advisor which, in turn, writes it to [Azure activity log](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md).

For two recommendations, the data is simultaneously written directly to Azure activity log. With this change, Security Center will stop writing data for these legacy security recommendations directly to activity Log. Instead, we'll export the data to Azure Advisor as we do for all the other recommendations. 

The two legacy recommendations are:
- Endpoint protection health issues should be resolved on your machines
- Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your machines should be remediated

If you've been accessing information for these two recommendations in activity log's "Recommendation of type TaskDiscovery" category, this will no longer be available.

### Two recommendations from "Apply system updates" security control being deprecated 

**Estimated date for change:** March 2021

The following two recommendations are scheduled to be deprecated in February 2021:

- **Your machines should be restarted to apply system updates**. This might result in a slight impact on your secure score.
- **Monitoring agent should be installed on your machines**. This recommendation relates to on-premises machines only and some of its logic will be transferred to another recommendation, **Log Analytics agent health issues should be resolved on your machines**. This might result in a slight impact on your secure score.

We recommend checking your continuous export and workflow automation configurations to see whether these recommendations are included in them. Also, any dashboards or other monitoring tools that might be using them should be updated accordingly.

Learn more about these recommendations in the [security recommendations reference page](recommendations-reference.md).


### Enhancements to SQL data classification recommendation

**Estimated date for change:** Q2 2021

The recommendation **Sensitive data in your SQL databases should be classified** in the **Apply data classification** security control will be replaced with a new version that's better aligned with Microsoft's data classification strategy. As a result the recommendation's ID will also change (currently, it's b0df6f56-862d-4730-8597-38c0fd4ebd59).


### Deprecation of 11 Azure Defender alerts

**Estimated date for change:** March 2021

Next month, the eleven Azure Defender alerts listed below will be deprecated.

- New alerts will replace these two alerts and provide better coverage:

    | AlertType                | AlertDisplayName                                                         |
    |--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ARM_MicroBurstDomainInfo | PREVIEW - MicroBurst toolkit "Get-AzureDomainInfo" function run detected |
    | ARM_MicroBurstRunbook    | PREVIEW - MicroBurst toolkit "Get-AzurePasswords" function run detected  |
    |                          |                                                                          |

- These nine alerts relate to an Azure Active Directory Identity Protection connector that has already been deprecated:

    | AlertType           | AlertDisplayName              |
    |---------------------|-------------------------------|
