# Azure Storage Archive, Backup, and Disaster Recovery partners

This article highlights Microsoft partners that are integrated with Azure Storage for Archive and BCDR workloads. They take advantage of the scale and [cost benefits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal) of Azure Storage to effectively solve backup challenges, create a disaster recovery site or archive unused content for long-term retention. With all the compliance standards that Azure Storage meets, and with [immutable storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-immutable-storage) and lifecycle management, these solutions can easily replace tape-based backups, and offer an on-demand economical recovery site.
